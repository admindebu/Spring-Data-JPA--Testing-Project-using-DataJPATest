@DataJpaTest is the annotation that Spring supports for a JPA test that focuses only on JPA components.

It will disable full auto-configuration and then, apply only enable configuration relevant to JPA tests. The list of the auto-configuration settings that are enabled can be found here.

By default, tests annotated with @DataJpaTest are transactional and roll back at the end of each test. If you donâ€™t want it, you can disable transaction management for a test or for the whole class using @Transactional annotation:

The purpose of the EntityManager is to interact with the persistence context. Spring Data JPA abstractes you from the EntityManager through Repository interfaces. And TestEntityManager allows us to use EntityManager in tests.

We can inject a TestEntityManager bean in Data JPA tests. If you want to use TestEntityManager outside of @DataJpaTest instances, just add @AutoConfigureTestEntityManager annotation.
